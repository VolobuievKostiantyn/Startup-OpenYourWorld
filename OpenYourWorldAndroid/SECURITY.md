Our app implements the following measures to protect user data and ensure a secure experience:

Encrypted Data: All user location data is encrypted during transmission (TLS) and at rest.
Minimal Data Collection: We only collect data necessary for the app's functionality and do not store historical location data without explicit user consent.
Permission Management: Users have full control over their location-sharing settings.
Regular Updates: Security patches are included in regular updates to ensure the app is protected against known vulnerabilities.
Security Features
Opt-In Location Tracking: Location tracking is disabled by default and can only be enabled with explicit user consent.
Background Location Access Warning: The app provides a clear explanation of why background location access is needed, in compliance with Android's guidelines.
Data Anonymization: Location data is anonymized to prevent identification of individual users.
