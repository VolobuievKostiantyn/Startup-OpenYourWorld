Main idea
User
Android application which will track user location and show already visited places on the Google map. Areas on the map which were not visited will be darkened. The same approach is used in some video games (example, Grand Theft Auto).


Designing an Android application that tracks user locations, displays visited places on a map, and darkens unvisited areas involves several key components. Below is a high-level design for such an application:

Components:
Location Tracking Service:

Implement a background service for continuous location tracking. Use the Android Location API to obtain location updates.
Geofencing:

Define geofences around visited places to efficiently detect when the user enters or exits specific areas.
Database:

Use a local database to store the user's location history, visited places, and other relevant data. SQLite or a lightweight NoSQL database could be suitable.
Map Integration:

Integrate Google Maps SDK to display the user's location, visited places, and unvisited areas on the map.
Darkening Effect:

For the darkening effect, overlay a semi-transparent layer on the map. Adjust the transparency dynamically based on the user's visited places.
User Interface:

Create an intuitive and user-friendly UI that displays the map, visited places, and user controls. Use fragments or activities to organize different sections.
Authentication and User Accounts:

Implement user authentication to provide a personalized experience. Allow users to sign in, and associate their location data with their accounts.
Settings:

Include settings to allow users to customize the application behavior, such as the granularity of location tracking, notification preferences, etc.
Workflow:
Location Tracking:

The location tracking service continuously monitors the user's location. Geofencing triggers events when the user enters or exits predefined areas.
Data Storage:

Store location data, including timestamps and coordinates, in the local database.
Map Rendering:

Render the user's current location, visited places, and unvisited areas on the map.
Darkening Effect:

Dynamically adjust the transparency of the overlay based on the user's visited places. Darken unvisited areas to create the desired effect.
User Interaction:

Allow users to interact with the map, view details about visited places, and customize settings.
Privacy Controls:

Implement privacy controls to allow users to manage their location data and provide clear opt-in/opt-out mechanisms.
Notifications:

Optionally, incorporate push notifications to inform users about nearby interesting places, achievements, or encourage exploration.
Sync and Cloud Integration:

Consider syncing location data with a cloud server for backup and cross-device synchronization.
Technologies:
Android Studio: Use the official IDE for Android development.
Java or Kotlin: Choose the preferred programming language.
Android Location API: For obtaining location updates.
Google Maps SDK: For map integration.
SQLite Database: For local storage.
Firebase or other Backend Service: For user authentication and cloud synchronization.
This high-level design provides a starting point, and the actual implementation would involve detailed considerations for performance, battery efficiency, and user experience. Additionally, be mindful of privacy and ensure compliance with relevant regulations when handling location data.

This diagram represents the main components of the Android application. Arrows indicate the flow of information or control. The "Database" component could involve the SQLite database for local storage. The "Authentication" component involves Firebase for user authentication. The "Map Integration" and "Darkening Effect" components are part of the visual representation on the user interface. The "Location Tracking Service" continuously updates the location and interacts with the other components as needed. The "Notifications" component may provide updates to the user based on their location or activities.
